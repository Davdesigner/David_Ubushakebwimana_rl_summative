### Post-Harvest Storage Management using Reinforcement Learning
Overview
This project aims to handle post-harvest crop loss due to inadequate storage. IIt aims to mitigate the use of chemical preservatives to protect stored crops, which may harm health, reduce crop quality, and lower market value.

Throughtout this project, a custom Reinforcement Learning environment simulating dynamic storage conditions—temperature, humidity, pest levels was developed and used to train intelligent agents to learn when and how to apply chemical-free interventions across storage zones. Agents operate in a 3-phase loop: Analyze → Navigate → Treat.

This system not only trains agents to make real-time decisions but also offers visual explanations and adaptive strategies based on the storage environment.
